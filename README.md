# 🚀 Overview:

Cloud-Native Retail Platform is a production-ready, distributed e-commerce architecture designed to demonstrate Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles at scale.

Unlike traditional monolithic applications, this platform utilizes a polyglot microservices architecture (Go, Java, Node.js) orchestrated on AWS EKS. It implements strict GitOps workflows using ArgoCD for zero-touch deployments, Terraform for immutable infrastructure, and RabbitMQ for event-driven resilience.
